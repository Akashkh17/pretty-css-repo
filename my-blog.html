        <h3 class="blog-tittle">A vacation is a leave of absence from a regular occupation, usually for the purpose of recreation or tourism.</h3>
        <small><Author:b><span class="author">OYACHKURUNY KHAN AKASH</span></Author:b></small>
        <p>People often take a vacation during specific holiday observances, or for specific festivals or celebrations. During the vacation of last semester, all my friends decided to go on a trip in Khagrachhari, more specifically in Sajek. Sajek is one of the most popular tourist places as this place is with the highest altitude in our country. </p>
        <p>Khagrachhari is one of the most remote places in Bangladesh that amazes people of every corners of the world. Khagrachhari is one of the most spectacular places with hills, forest, waterfalls and the life of aborigine in Bangladesh. There are so many popular tourist spots in Khagrachhari District of Bangladesh. Traveler will find the natural wild beauty and realize the tribal culture by visiting Khagrachhari. If you are a photographer you have so many subjects, if you are a tourist you have so many spots to visit.</p>
        <p>Now after a long journey of almost ten hours we reached Khagrachhari, still having a four hour journey left to our destination Sajek. It was still raining the same like last night. We were enjoying every moment there. We took a short break there, had our breakfast there and prepared ourselves for an exciting mountainous journey in an off road four-wheeler. After setting up everything we just hoped into the jeep for our final destination. It was still raining the same way, but we were enjoying ourselves. The ride in the mountainous road seemed like a rollercoaster ride. It was really fun.</p>
        <p>Suddenly everything just messed up when a huge pile of soil and trees just slammed in the bonnet of our car. Yes, it was a landslide! Not one actually there were several landslides. We just jumped out of the car to save our lives. But who knows there the roads for Khagrachhari and Sajek blocked by landslide. So we can’t even go back.</p>

        <p>St. Martin is generally known as “Narikel Zinzira” in Bengali, means 'Coconut Island’ and this is the only coral reef island in Bangladesh. It is a small island in the north eastern part of the Bay of Bengal, created the southernmost part of our country. It is about 8 km west of the northwest coast of Myanmar, at the mouth of the Naf River. It is only 8 sq. Kilometre in size. Experts separate this island into three parts. Northern part is called Narikel Jinjira. It is 2. 134 km long and 1, 402 m wide. The southern part is called Dakkhin Para by the local and its length and width are successively 1929 m and 1890 m. The middle part which known as Maddhapara locally. The length and width respectively 1524m and 518m.The island is very much ingenious with vast biological variety such as existing fauna and flora Coral, Mollusk, Fish, Amphibian, Turtle, Snail, Bird and Mammals. Besides above coconut tree is the important cash crop.</p>
        <p>St. Martin is one of the most beautiful visiting places of Bangladesh. It has fresh blue water with     corals, beautiful sandy beaches, a lot of coconut trees, and huge natural beauties.
        Sunrise and sunset are two most striking things you can enjoy. You can catch the pleasure from the freshness of the air and the purity of the young sun. Rise early in the morning, take a walk in the sandy beaches, take a deep breath in the fresh air of morning and then enjoy the beauty of the early rising sun. Seems like removing the veil from it, the sun welcome you with warmth. It will be really enjoyable for everyone.
        You then can take your shower by swimming in the fresh blue cold water which can give you more freshness than a spa!! Take your breakfast with fresh fried lobster and bread and get ready for your visit. You can take a walk in the island because it is only 8 sq. Kilometre to cover!
        In addition to the main island there are some small islands are found here. There is a place or Dwip, known as Cheradiya or Cheradwip which means “Separate Island”. Though there are numbers of separated small islands in St. Martin Island, but Cheradiya is most popular for visiting. Not so far from main Island, takes only a 1.5 or 2 hours motor boat riding to reach. There is a green bush and lots of corals in the water in Cheradiya. This place will give you a feeling that you are the only person in the whole world. Such a quite place it is!!</p>

    <p>The Sundarbans mangrove forest, one of the largest such forests in the world (140,000 ha), lies on the delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers on the Bay of Bengal. It is adjacent to the border of India’s Sundarbans World Heritage site inscribed in 1987. The site is intersected by a complex network of tidal waterways, mudflats and small islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests, and presents an excellent example of ongoing ecological processes. The area is known for its wide range of fauna, including 260 bird species, the Bengal tiger and other threatened species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.</p>
